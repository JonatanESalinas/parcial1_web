and its purpose is to allow to visitor to consult the standings of the "LigaMX" soccer league from Mexico.
It displays a table with the current tournament standings, including each team's position, logo, name and
points.

It also includes a section to consult information about the LigaMX teams. This section displays the name of the
selected team, its logo, year of foundation, stadium, stadium's capacity, city of origin, and a picture of

The information to fill the standings table and the information to display each team's information is gotten from
the [Api-Football](https://www.api-football.com) API using jQuery. Docker was used to put the web page on a
Google Cloud server. You can visit the web page using this direction: http://34.102.0.104

## Description
This is a basic web page project made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The web page is called "LigaMX Portal"
and its purpose is to allow to visitor to consult the standings of the "LigaMX" soccer league from Mexico.
It displays a table with the current tournament standings, including each team's position, logo, name and
points.

It also includes a section to consult information about the LigaMX teams. This section displays the name of the
selected team, its logo, year of foundation, stadium, stadium's capacity, city of origin, and a picture of
the stadium.

The "Contact" section displays an alert message, only for demonstration purposes.

The information to fill the standings table and the information to display each team's information is gotten from
the [Api-Football](https://www.api-football.com) API using jQuery. Docker was used to put the web page on a
Google Cloud server.
